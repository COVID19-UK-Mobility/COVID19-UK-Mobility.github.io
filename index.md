### General Information

As April 03rd the number of cases of COVID-19 reported in the UK were more than 33K counting more the 3.5K casualties. Europe and USA are now at the center of the pandemic. 
Folowing the lead of the countries that were the first to be impacted by the virus (China and Sounth Korea), countries around the world are limiting the people movements and implmenteing policy to foster the social distancing in order to containg the spreding of the virus.


A key indicator to evaluate the effectiveness of these restrictions and assess the compliance of the population is the reduction in mobility. Here, we will use a large, national-scale data set on human mobility, provided by the collaboration with Cuebiq, to evaluate the adherence to these measures by the general population.

This report has been based on similar analysis carried on Italian data
