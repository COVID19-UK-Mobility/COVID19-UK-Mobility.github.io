This website contains our reports assessing changes in human mobility across the UK during the Covid-19 health crisis.

As of early April, the number of cases of COVID-19 reported in the UK were more than 33,000, with more the 3,500 casualties.
Folowing the lead of the countries that were the first to be impacted by the virus (China and Sounth Korea), countries around the world are limiting people's movement and implementing restriction measures to increase social distances and contain the spreading of the virus.
<br>
A key indicator to evaluate the effectiveness of these restrictions and assess the compliance of the population is the reduction in mobility. Here, we will use a large, national-scale data set on human mobility, provided by the collaboration with Cuebiq, to evaluate the adherence to these measures by the general population.

These reports are based on similar analysis carried on Italian data

## Timeline of COVID-19 development in the UK
In January 2020, cases of the novel coronavirus started being reported outside of China. These cases were typically from people who had recently travelled to the Chinese Hubei province, where the disease started spreading. Events related to COVID-19 in the UK started unfolding at the end of January, with the first reported cases in the country. A brief timeline for the UK is the following:
   * <b>31st January 2020</b>: two Chinese nationals, one of whom studied at the University of York, were the first confirmed cases in the UK.
   * <b>6th February 2020</b>: a man in Brighton became the third confirmed case in the UK. He had previously travelled to Singapore and then visited a ski resort in France.
   * <b>10th February 2020</b>: the number of confirmed cases in the UK increases to 10, due to infections linked to the man in Brighton.
   * <b>27th February 2020</b>: the total number of confirmed cases is 16, with the first signs of infections spreading from the outbreak in Northern Italy due to people travelling back from the affected regions.
   * <b>1st March 2020</b>: the official number of cases is 36, and there are signs of infections amongst people with no history of recent travel abroad.
   * <b>11th March 2020</b>: the confirmed cases in the UK are now 456. The World Health Organisation declares the outbreak a pandemic.
   * <b>12th March 2020</b>: the UK Chief Medical Office raises the risk from moderate to high. Anyone with a new continuous cough or a fever is recommended to self-isolate for seven days, schools cancel trips abroad and people over 70 are asked to avoid cruises.
   * <b>13th March 2020</b>: many sporting events are postponed, as well as the 2020 UK local elections.
   * <b>16th March 2020</b>: the number of cases is over 1,500, and the number of deaths is 55. The Prime Minister advises against non essential travelling, and encourages people to avoid pubs, clubs and theatres. Working from home is encouraged.
   * <b>23rd March 2020</b>: the Prime Minister announces stricter measures for the UK. People are asked to stay home except for essential food shopping, essential work travel and one form of exercise per day only with members of their household.
   * <b>26th March 2020</b>: the death toll is 422, and the number of people that tested positive is 11,568.
