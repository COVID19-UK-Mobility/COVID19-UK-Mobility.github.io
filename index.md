### Timeline of COVID-19 development in the UK
In January 2020, cases of the novel coronavirus started being reported outside of China. These cases were typically from people who had recently travelled to the Chinese Hubei province, where the disease started spreading. Events related to COVID-19 in the UK started unfolding at the end of January, with the first reported cases in the country. A brief timeline for the UK is the following:

   * <b>10th February 2020</b>: the number of confirmed cases in the UK increases to 10, due to infections linked to the man in Brighton.
   * <b>27th February 2020</b>: the total number of confirmed cases is 16, with the first signs of infections spreading from the outbreak in Northern Italy due to people travelling back from the affected regions.

The analysis never singled out identifiable individuals and no attempts were made to link these data to third party data about an individual. The residential areas are inferred at an aggregated county level, thereby allowing for demographic analysis while obfuscating the true home location of anonymous users and prohibiting misuse of data.
